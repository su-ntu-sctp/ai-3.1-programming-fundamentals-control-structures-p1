# Part 1: Installation of JDK and Extension

Note:

1. Windows users need to install WSL2 to follow this lesson.

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

2. Git setup for WSL

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git

## Terminology

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Toolkit wich includes the Java compiler and runtime environment for developers to write code (also called SDK in earlier versions).
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - Consists of JVM, core classes and supporting libraries. It is required to run Java applications.
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) - A platform-independent virtual machine that runs Java bytecode. All Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM.

More info: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/difference-jdk-vs-jre-vs-jvm

When you install JDK, JRE is part of it.

## SDKMan

SDKMan is a popular command line tool for managing multiple versions of SDKs on Unix-based systems (Linux and Mac). Commonly used to manage JDK versions.

Benefits  :

- Multiple JDK versions: easily install, manage and switch between multiple versions of JDK.
  - Useful when working on different projects that require different JDK versions, or testing application compatibility across different versions.
- Isolation: JDKs are installed in local directory, avoiding conflicts with system-wide JDK installation.
- Easy updates: Update itself and all SDKs with a single command.

Install SDKMan:

```bash
# Note: For WSL users, you will need to install zip and unzip first.
$ sudo apt install zip unzip

$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

After installation, you will need to run this line to initialize SDKMan:

```bash
$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Check if sdkman is installed:

```bash
$ sdk version
```

## Install JDK

List the available Java SDKs:

```bash
$ sdk list java
```

We will install **Eclipse Temurin JDK 21** because it is the current **LTS** release with long‚Äëterm support. LTS stands for **Long‚ÄëTerm Support**, which means this version will receive updates for an extended period. Refer to the Java SE Support Roadmap for exact timelines.

> Java SE Support Roadmap: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html

```bash
# Choose the latest version of Java 21 e.g. 21.0.x-tem
$ sdk install java 21.x.x-tem
```

Check if Java is installed:

```bash
$ java -version
```

## JShell

Jshell is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) tool that allows you to execute Java code in an interactive manner. This is useful for testing out simple Java code without having to create a Java project.

Start jshell in your terminal:

```bash
$ jshell
```

Try your first Java code:

```bash
jshell> System.out.println("Hello World");
Hello World
jshell> /exit
```

## Install Extension Pack for Java

This is a collection of extensions that can help you write Java code in VSCode.

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack

## Part 2 - `class` and `main` method

### Step 1: Create a `Main.java` file

In the root folder, create a file named `Main.java`.

The naming convention for a `class` is to use **PascalCase**. This means that the first letter of each word is capitalized.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html

### Step 2: Define a class `Main`. The class name must be identical to the filename.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println(args[0]);
  }
}
```

- `class` is used to define a class.
- `main` is the entry point of all Java projects.
- `System.out.println(args[0])` will output its value to the console.
- `public` is an access modifier. It means that the class is accessible to all other classes.

---

## Part 3 - Compile and Run

To compile the file, we use the `javac` command on the java file. This generates a `.class` file of the same name.

Then, we use the `java` command to run the `.class` file. String values can be passed into the `main` method as arguments.

```sh
$ javac Main.java
$ java Main "Hello World"
```

You may also run the code directly from VSCode using the "Run Java" button.

---

## Part 4 - Variables & Data Types

### Step 1: Create `LearnDataTypes.java`

### Step 2: Insert the following code

```java
public class LearnDataTypes {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int num1 = 10;
        // The String needs to be converted into an Integer
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        System.out.println(num1 + num2);
    }
}
```

ü§î Try replacing `Integer.parseInt(args[0])` with just `args[0]`. What happens and why?

In Java, variables must belong to a data type.

There are 8 primitive data types in Java:

| Whole Number | Decimal | Single Char | Boolean |
| :----------: | :-----: | :---------: | :-----: |
|     byte     |  float  |    char     | boolean |
|    short     | double  |
|     int      |         |
|     long     |         |

You cannot perform `11 + "1"`. This expression adds a `String` value of `1` to `int` value of `11`, which would not work. Therefore, we had to perform `Integer.parseInt()` to parse a `String` to an `Integer`.

### Casting

Casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

Casting can be done **explicitly** or **implicitly**.

**Explicit casting** is done by the developer using the `()` operator.

```java
int a = 10;
double b = 1.5;
int result = a + (int) b;
```

**Implicit casting** is done automatically by the compiler.

```java
int a = 10;
double b = 1.5;
double result = a + b;
```

This is possible because the converted value (`int`) fits within the range of the new data type (`double`).

In Java, there are two types of casting:

- **Widening Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size.
- **Narrowing Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type.

```java
// Widening Casting
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0

// Narrowing Casting
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int

System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
```

#### Converting from `String` to `Integer`

The earlier way of using `Integer.parseInt()` is for converting a `String` to an `Integer`. It uses the `parseInt()` method from the `Integer` class. This is not the same as casting, which uses the `()` operator.

The following methods can convert String to numeric primitive types:
| Method | Example |
| :----: | :-----: |
| `Byte.parseByte()` | `byte num = Byte.parseByte("10");` |
|`Short.parseShort()` | `short num = Short.parseShort("10");` |
| `Integer.parseInt()` | `int num = Integer.parseInt("10");` |
| `Long.parseLong()` | `long num = Long.parseLong("10000000000");` |
| `Float.parseFloat()` | `float num = Float.parseFloat("1.5");` |
| `Double.parseDouble()` | `double num = Double.parseDouble("1.5");` |
|`Boolean.parseBoolean()` | `boolean bool = Boolean.parseBoolean("true");` |

### Numeric Literal Character Suffixes

Numeric literal character suffixes are used to indicate the type of the numeric literal.

```java
// L suffix for long
long longNum = 10000000000L;

// F suffix for float
float floatNum = 1.5F;

// D suffix for double
double doubleNum = 1.5D;
```

Why do we need to specify the type of the numeric literal?

- Without the suffix, the compiler will generally treat a whole number as an `int`, and a decimal number as a `double`.

```java
// Compiler treats 1.5 as a double
float f = 1.5; // Error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float

// For double, the suffix is optional
double d = 1.5; // No error
```

‚û° Demo with int, long and casting

### üë®‚Äçüíª Activity: Try out the different data types

Try initializing the following five data types and print them

- `String`
- `char`
- `int`
- `float`
- `boolean`

Your code should look something like this:

```java
public class LearnDataTypes {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    // Initializing variables of different data types here

    // Print them onto the console.

  }
}
```

Compile and run the program. This is the expected output:

```
11
myName prints Neo
a prints x
n prints 5
f prints 1.45
x prints true
```

## Part 5 - Wrapper Classes, Boxing and Unboxing

### Wrapper Classes

Recall Java has 8 primitive data types. For each of those types, there is a corresponding wrapper class (classes will be covered in more detail in a later lesson).

| Primitive Data Type | Wrapper Class |
| :-----------------: | :-----------: |
|        byte         |     Byte      |
|        short        |     Short     |
|        char         |   Character   |
|         int         |    Integer    |
|        long         |     Long      |
|        float        |     Float     |
|       double        |    Double     |
|       boolean       |    Boolean    |

Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types as objects, as well as provide some simple operations, which cannot be stored on a primitive.

For example, as you saw earlier, the `Integer` class provide a useful method to convert a `String` to an `Integer`.

```java
int num = Integer.parseInt("10");
```

You can also check the maximum and minimum values of an `Integer`.

```java
System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```

We can declare an `Integer` object like this instead using the primitive data type:

```java
Integer num = 10;
```

But as a rule of thumb, it is better to use the primitive data type unless you need to use the wrapper class methods.

### Boxing and Unboxing

Boxing is the process of converting a primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper class.

Java does autoboxing, which is the automatic conversion of a primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper class.

```java
Integer boxedNum = 10;
```

Unboxing is the process of converting a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive data type.

Java does auto-unboxing, which is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive data type.

```java
int unboxedNum = boxedNum;
```

## Part 6 - Reading User Input

There are a few ways to read a user's input. We will be using `System.console().readLine()`.

### Step 1: Create `UserInputDemo.java`

### Step 2: Insert the following code

```java
public class UserInputDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String userInput = System.console().readLine("Enter your name:");
    System.out.println("Hello " + userInput);
  }
}
```

### üë®‚Äçüíª Activity: Get 2 numbers from user and add them

Create a new file `AddTwoNumbers.java` and write a program that reads 2 numbers from the console and add them together.

---

## Part 7: Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

The basic types of operators:

- Arithmetic
- Unary
- Assignment
- Relational
- Logical / Conditional

You can create a `LearnOperators.java` file and code along as we go through these operators.

```java
public class LearnOperators {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;
  }
}
```

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator |  Description   | Example |
| :------: | :------------: | :-----: |
|    +     |    Addition    |  x + y  |
|    -     |  Subtraction   |  x - y  |
|    \*    | Multiplication | x \* y  |
|    /     |    Division    |  x / y  |
|    %     |   Remainder    |  x % y  |

Notes:

- `+` is also used to concatenate strings e.g. `"Hello" + "World"` becomes `"HelloWorld"`.

```java
System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
System.out.println("b % a = " + (b % a));
```

### Unary Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :------: | :---------: | :-----: |
|    +     |    Plus     |   +x    |
|    -     |    Minus    |   -x    |
|    ++    |  Increment  |   ++x   |
|    --    |  Decrement  |   --x   |
|    !     |     NOT     |   !x    |

```java
int unaryPlus = +10;
int unaryMinus = -10;
System.out.println("unaryPlus: " + unaryPlus);
System.out.println("unaryMinus: " + unaryMinus);

int preIncrement = ++unaryPlus;
System.out.println("preIncrement: " + preIncrement);

int preDecrement = --unaryMinus;
System.out.println("preDecrement: " + preDecrement);

int postIncrement = unaryPlus++;
System.out.println("postIncrement: " + postIncrement);

int postDecrement = unaryMinus--;
System.out.println("postDecrement: " + postDecrement);

boolean isTrue = true;
System.out.println("isTrue: " + isTrue);
System.out.println("!isTrue: " + !isTrue);
```

Observe the output of the above code. What is the difference between pre and post increment/decrement?

#### Pre vs Post Increment/Decrement:

Pre-increment/decrement operators increment/decrement the value of the variable **before** returning the value.

Post-increment/decrement operators increment/decrement the value of the variable **after** returning the value.

```java
int x = 10;
int y = 10;

System.out.println("x: " + x);
System.out.println("y: " + y);

System.out.println("x++: " + x++);
System.out.println("++y: " + ++y);

System.out.println("x: " + x);
System.out.println("y: " + y);
```

### Assignment and Compound Assignment Operators

- Assignment `=`
- Compound Assignment:

| Operator |  Description   | Example |
| :------: | :------------: | :-----: |
|    +=    |    Addition    | x += y  |
|    -=    |  Subtraction   | x -= y  |
|   \*=    | Multiplication | x \*= y |
|    /=    |    Division    | x /= y  |
|    %=    |   Remainder    | x %= y  |

Notes:

- Compound assignment operators are shorthand for performing an operation and assigning the result to the same variable. For example, `x += y` is the same as `x = x + y`.
- Compound operators cannot be used to declare variables. For example, `int x += 5` is invalid.

```java
int compoundAdd = 8;
compoundAdd += 10;
System.out.println("compoundAdd: " + compoundAdd);

int compoundSub = 10;
compoundSub -= 5;
System.out.println("compoundSub: " + compoundSub);
System.out.println();
```

### Relational Operators

| Operator |    Description     | Example |
| :------: | :----------------: | :-----: |
|    ==    |       Equals       | x == y  |
|    !=    |     Not Equal      | x != y  |
|    >     |      Greater       |  x > y  |
|    >=    |  Greater or Equal  | x >= y  |
|    <     |     Less Than      |  x < y  |
|    <=    | Less Than or Equal | x <= y  |

```java
System.out.println("a == b: " + (a == b));
System.out.println("a != b: " + (a != b));
System.out.println("a > b: " + (a > b));
System.out.println("a >= b: " + (a >= b));
System.out.println("a < b: " + (a < b));
System.out.println("a <= b: " + (a <= b));
```

### Logical / Conditional Operators

| Operator | Description |  Example  |
| :------: | :---------: | :-------: |
|    &&    |     AND     |  x && y   |
|   \|\|   |     OR      | x \|\| y  |
|    !     |     NOT     |    !x     |
|   ? :    |   Ternary   | x ? y : z |

```java
boolean value1 = true;
boolean value2 = false;
System.out.println("value1 && value2: " + (value1 && value2));
System.out.println("value1 || value2: " + (value1 || value2));
System.out.println("!value1: " + (!value1));
System.out.println(a > b ? "a is larger" : "b is larger");
```

### Type Comparison Operator

|  Operator  |    Example     |
| :--------: | :------------: |
| instanceof | x instanceof y |

You can use the `instanceof` operator to check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an instance of a subclass of that class.

```java
String name = "John";
System.out.println("name is String?" + name instanceof String);
```

### Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

| Operator | Precedence |
| :------: | :--------: |
|    ()    |     15     |
|    !     |     13     |
|    \*    |     12     |
|    /     |     12     |
|    %     |     12     |
|    +     |     11     |
|    -     |     11     |

```java
int order1 = 10 + 5 * 2;
int order2 = (10 + 5) * 2;
System.out.println("10 + 5 * 2: " + order1);
System.out.println("(10 + 5) * 2: " + order2);
```
