# Part 1: Installation of JDK and Extension

Note:

1. Windows users need to install WSL2 to follow this lesson.

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

2. Git setup for WSL

- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git

## Terminology

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Toolkit wich includes the Java compiler and runtime environment for developers to write code (also called SDK in earlier versions).
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) - Consists of JVM, core classes and supporting libraries. It is required to run Java applications.
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM) - A platform-independent virtual machine that runs Java bytecode. All Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the JVM.

More info: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/difference-jdk-vs-jre-vs-jvm

When you install JDK, JRE is part of it.

## SDKMan

SDKMan is a popular command line tool for managing multiple versions of SDKs on Unix-based systems (Linux and Mac). Commonly used to manage JDK versions.

Benefits  :

- Multiple JDK versions: easily install, manage and switch between multiple versions of JDK.
  - Useful when working on different projects that require different JDK versions, or testing application compatibility across different versions.
- Isolation: JDKs are installed in local directory, avoiding conflicts with system-wide JDK installation.
- Easy updates: Update itself and all SDKs with a single command.

Install SDKMan:

```bash
# Note: For WSL users, you will need to install zip and unzip first.
$ sudo apt install zip unzip

$ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

After installation, you will need to run this line to initialize SDKMan:

```bash
$ source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Check if sdkman is installed:

```bash
$ sdk version
```

## Install JDK

List the available Java SDKs:

```bash
$ sdk list java
```

We will install **Eclipse Temurin JDK 21** because it is the current **LTS** release with long‑term support. LTS stands for **Long‑Term Support**, which means this version will receive updates for an extended period. Refer to the Java SE Support Roadmap for exact timelines.

> Java SE Support Roadmap: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html

```bash
# Choose the latest version of Java 21 e.g. 21.0.x-tem
$ sdk install java 21.x.x-tem
```

Check if Java is installed:

```bash
$ java -version
```

## JShell

Jshell is a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) tool that allows you to execute Java code in an interactive manner. This is useful for testing out simple Java code without having to create a Java project.

Start jshell in your terminal:

```bash
$ jshell
```

Try your first Java code:

```bash
jshell> System.out.println("Hello World");
Hello World
jshell> /exit
```

## Install Extension Pack for Java

This is a collection of extensions that can help you write Java code in VSCode.

## Part 2 - `class` and `main` method

### Step 1: Create a `Main.java` file

In the root folder, create a file named `Main.java`.

The naming convention for a `class` is to use **PascalCase**. This means that the first letter of each word is capitalized.

https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html

### Step 2: Define a class `Main`. The class name must be identical to the filename.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    System.out.println(args[0]);
  }
}
```

- `class` is used to define a class.
- `main` is the entry point of all Java projects.
- `System.out.println(args[0])` will output its value to the console.
- `public` is an access modifier. It means that the class is accessible to all other classes.

---

## Part 3 - Compile and Run

To compile the file, we use the `javac` command on the java file. This generates a `.class` file of the same name.

Then, we use the `java` command to run the `.class` file. String values can be passed into the `main` method as arguments.

```sh
$ javac Main.java
$ java Main "Hello World"
```

You may also run the code directly from VSCode using the "Run Java" button.

## Part 4 - Variables & Data Types

### Step 1: Create `LearnDataTypes.java`

### Step 2: Insert the following code

```java
public class LearnDataTypes {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        int num1 = 10;
        // The String needs to be converted into an Integer
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        System.out.println(num1 + num2);
    }
}
```

🤔 Try replacing `Integer.parseInt(args[0])` with just `args[0]`. What happens and why?

In Java, variables must belong to a data type.

There are 8 primitive data types in Java:

| Whole Number | Decimal | Single Char | Boolean |
| :----------: | :-----: | :---------: | :-----: |
|     byte     |  float  |    char     | boolean |
|    short     | double  |
|     int      |         |
|     long     |         |

You cannot perform `11 + "1"`. This expression adds a `String` value of `1` to `int` value of `11`, which would not work. Therefore, we had to perform `Integer.parseInt()` to parse a `String` to an `Integer`.

### Casting

Casting is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.

Casting can be done **explicitly** or **implicitly**.

**Explicit casting** is done by the developer using the `()` operator.

```java
int a = 10;
double b = 1.5;
int result = a + (int) b;
```

**Implicit casting** is done automatically by the compiler.

```java
int a = 10;
double b = 1.5;
double result = a + b;
```

This is possible because the converted value (`int`) fits within the range of the new data type (`double`).

In Java, there are two types of casting:

- **Widening Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size.
- **Narrowing Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type.

```java
// Widening Casting
int myInt = 9;
double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0

// Narrowing Casting
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int

System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
```

#### Converting from `String` to `Integer`

The earlier way of using `Integer.parseInt()` is for converting a `String` to an `Integer`. It uses the `parseInt()` method from the `Integer` class. This is not the same as casting, which uses the `()` operator.

The following methods can convert String to numeric primitive types:
| Method | Example |
| :----: | :-----: |
| `Byte.parseByte()` | `byte num = Byte.parseByte("10");` |
|`Short.parseShort()` | `short num = Short.parseShort("10");` |
| `Integer.parseInt()` | `int num = Integer.parseInt("10");` |
| `Long.parseLong()` | `long num = Long.parseLong("10000000000");` |
| `Float.parseFloat()` | `float num = Float.parseFloat("1.5");` |
| `Double.parseDouble()` | `double num = Double.parseDouble("1.5");` |
|`Boolean.parseBoolean()` | `boolean bool = Boolean.parseBoolean("true");` |

### Numeric Literal Character Suffixes

Numeric literal character suffixes are used to indicate the type of the numeric literal.

```java
// L suffix for long
long longNum = 10000000000L;

// F suffix for float
float floatNum = 1.5F;

// D suffix for double
double doubleNum = 1.5D;
```

Why do we need to specify the type of the numeric literal?

- Without the suffix, the compiler will generally treat a whole number as an `int`, and a decimal number as a `double`.

```java
// Compiler treats 1.5 as a double
float f = 1.5; // Error: incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to float

// For double, the suffix is optional
double d = 1.5; // No error
```

➡ Demo with int, long and casting

### 👨‍💻 Activity: Try out the different data types

Try initializing the following five data types and print them

- `String`
- `char`
- `int`
- `float`
- `boolean`

Your code should look something like this:

```java
public class LearnDataTypes {
  public static void main(String args[]){
    // Initializing variables of different data types here

    // Print them onto the console.

  }
}
```

Compile and run the program. This is the expected output:

```
11
myName prints Neo
a prints x
n prints 5
f prints 1.45
x prints true
```

## Part 5 - Wrapper Classes, Boxing and Unboxing

### Wrapper Classes

Recall Java has 8 primitive data types. For each of those types, there is a corresponding wrapper class (classes will be covered in more detail in a later lesson).

| Primitive Data Type | Wrapper Class |
| :-----------------: | :-----------: |
|        byte         |     Byte      |
|        short        |     Short     |
|        char         |   Character   |
|         int         |    Integer    |
|        long         |     Long      |
|        float        |     Float     |
|       double        |    Double     |
|       boolean       |    Boolean    |

Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types as objects, as well as provide some simple operations, which cannot be stored on a primitive.

For example, as you saw earlier, the `Integer` class provide a useful method to convert a `String` to an `Integer`.

```java
int num = Integer.parseInt("10");
```

You can also check the maximum and minimum values of an `Integer`.

```java
System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
```

We can declare an `Integer` object like this instead using the primitive data type:

```java
Integer num = 10;
```

But as a rule of thumb, it is better to use the primitive data type unless you need to use the wrapper class methods.

### Boxing and Unboxing

Boxing is the process of converting a primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper class.

Java does autoboxing, which is the automatic conversion of a primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper class.

```java
Integer boxedNum = 10;
```

Unboxing is the process of converting a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive data type.

Java does auto-unboxing, which is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive data type.

```java
int unboxedNum = boxedNum;
```

## Part 6 - Reading User Input

There are a few ways to read a user's input. We will be using `System.console().readLine()`.

### Step 1: Create `UserInputDemo.java`

### Step 2: Insert the following code

```java
public class UserInputDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String userInput = System.console().readLine("Enter your name:");
    System.out.println("Hello " + userInput);
  }
}
```

### 👨‍💻 Activity: Get 2 numbers from user and add them

Create a new file `AddTwoNumbers.java` and write a program that reads 2 numbers from the console and add them together.

## Part 7 - Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

```java
int a = 10, b = 5;
System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b));
System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b));
System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b));
System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b));
System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b));
```

### Relational Operators

```java
System.out.println("a > b? " + (a > b));
System.out.println("a < b? " + (a < b));
System.out.println("a == b? " + (a == b));
System.out.println("a != b? " + (a != b));
```

### Logical Operators

```java
System.out.println("a > 0 && b > 0: " + (a > 0 && b > 0));
System.out.println("a > 0 || b < 0: " + (a > 0 || b < 0));
System.out.println("!(a > b): " + !(a > b));
```

### Assignment Operators

```java
int c = 7;
c += 3; // same as c = c + 3
System.out.println("c after += 3: " + c);

c *= 2;
System.out.println("c after *= 2: " + c);
```

### Increment/Decrement

```java
int d = 4;
d++;
System.out.println("d after increment: " + d);

d--;
System.out.println("d after decrement: " + d);
```

### 👨‍💻 Activity

Create `OperatorsDemo.java` that demonstrates:
- Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.  
- Assignment and increment/decrement usage.
